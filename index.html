                <h3 class="mt-5">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                <div class="curriculum-item">
                    <h4>Why choose continuous classes over workshops?</h4>
                    <p>R has a steeper learning curve compared to other programming languages. Our continuous class format allows for better retention, practice between sessions, and gradual skill building. This approach is much more effective than intensive workshops for mastering R programming.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="curriculum-item">
                    <h4>What if I miss a class?</h4>
                    <p>All classes are recorded and made available to participants for review and future reference. If you miss a session, you can catch up on the content at your own pace through these recordings. Additionally, I offer compensation classes for those who need extra support or have scheduling conflicts. I am fully committed to ensuring that every participant has the opportunity to successfully complete the course.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="curriculum-item">
                    <h4>Do I need prior programming experience?</h4>
                    <p>No prior programming experience is required for the basic curriculum. We start from the fundamentals and gradually build up your skills.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="curriculum-item">
                    <h4>What software do I need?</h4>
                    <p>You'll need R and RStudio installed on your computer. Both are free software. We'll guide you through the installation process in the first class. An additional prerequisite is a good internet connection and a computer/laptop in good working condition.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="curriculum-item">
                    <h4>How does the capstone project work?</h4>
                    <p>The capstone project is a practical application where you'll use all the skills learned throughout the course to complete a real-world data analysis project. This project is required for certification.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="curriculum-item">
